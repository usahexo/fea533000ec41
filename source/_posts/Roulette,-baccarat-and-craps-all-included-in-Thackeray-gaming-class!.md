#  Take your pick: Roulette, baccarat or craps at Thackeray Casino?

If you're looking for a thrilling casino experience, head to Thackeray Casino in downtown Reno. You can choose from roulette, baccarat or craps tables – each with its own unique excitement.

Roulette is the classic casino game that's always exciting to play. There are several different bets you can make, each with its own payout. The wheel has 37 numbered slots – 18 black and 18 red, plus a green zero. When the ball drops into a slot, the player who placed the bet on that number wins.

Baccarat is another popular casino game. There are three possible outcomes: player win, banker win or tie. Players can bet on any of these outcomes, and the payout is based on the odds of that outcome happening. This makes baccarat a great game for players who want to bet on long shots.

Craps is a dice game where players bet on the outcome of two dice rolls. There are several different bets you can make, each with its own payout. The most common bet is called pass/don't pass, where players bet whether or not the shooter will roll a point (a number other than 7). If they do roll a point, players can then make additional bets on the come out roll (the next roll of the dice).

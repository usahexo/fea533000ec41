#  Increased economic activity

The global economy is showing signs of increased economic activity, with both developed and emerging market economies expanding at a faster pace. This is good news for the world and offers opportunities for businesses and investors alike.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which comprises 36 member nations, recently reported that the global economy is enjoying its fastest expansion since 2011. The OECD projects that global growth will reach 3.9% in 2018 and 2019, up from 3.7% in 2017.1

One of the key drivers of this growth is the improved performance of the world’s large economies. The United States, Japan, Germany, France and Italy are all growing at a faster pace this year than last year. In fact, the US economy is on track to grow by more than 3% in 2018, marking the fastest expansion in over a decade.2

Emerging market economies are also doing well, with many of them growing at a faster pace than their developed counterparts. This is helping to offset some of the slowdown in trade and investment seen in recent years.

What does this mean for businesses?

This expansion offers opportunities for businesses across the globe. The faster growth rates are fuelling demand for goods and services, providing a boost to companies operating in both developed and emerging market economies.

In addition, favourable interest rates and increasing investor confidence are helping to spur business investment. This is benefiting companies that are able to invest in new products, processes or services and increase their productivity. Finally, rising wages are giving consumers more spending power, providing further opportunities for businesses that can tap into this demand.

What does this mean for investors?

The improving global economy offers opportunities for investors across all asset classes. In particular, equities appear attractive given their relatively low valuations relative to historical norms and expectations of rising earnings.3 Additionally, investors can also find attractive investments in bonds and other fixed-income securities as yields have risen somewhat in recent months but remain relatively low by historical standards.4

#  Job creation

The creation of jobs has been and always will be a fundamental issue in economics. It is the bread and butter of economists and politicians alike. Ask any economist and they will tell you that job creation is key to economic prosperity. The politician will often echo this sentiment by saying that creating jobs is their number one priority. While there is no single silver bullet to creating jobs, there are a few policies and practices that can help stimulate job growth.

One of the most important things for job creation is a strong economy. A strong economy creates demand for products and services, which in turn creates jobs. This can be done through a variety of means such as lowering taxes, reducing regulations, and increasing government spending. Another way to create jobs is through entrepreneurship. This can be done through programs that offer loans or grants to small businesses, or by reducing the tax burden on small businesses.

Employers are also important for job creation. By offering higher wages and benefits, they can attract good employees and help stimulate the economy. Additionally, employers can help create new jobs by investing in new technology and equipment which helps increase productivity and grow the business.

Education is another key factor for job creation. By increasing the number of people with college degrees or specialized training, employers will have access to a larger pool of workers with the necessary skills to fill open positions. Additionally, education helps people become more innovative and productive, which can lead to new businesses and more jobs being created.

Helping people find work is another important factor for stimulating job growth. This can be done through programs that match workers with available jobs, or by providing assistance to those who are struggling to find employment. Governments at all levels can do their part in creating an environment that is conducive to job growth.

Ultimately, there is no single solution to creating jobs; it takes a variety of measures working together in order to achieve this goal. By following the policies and practices mentioned above, policymakers and economists can work together to create an environment where job growth is possible

#  Consumer spending

Looking at consumer spending as a whole, it's evident that there is tremendous variety from one person to the next. Some households spend lavishly on a wide range of items, while others are much more frugal and narrowly focus their spending. However, despite this variation, there are some general trends that can be observed in terms of consumer spending.

One such trend is the large discrepancy between the amount spent by different age groups. For example, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people under the age of 35 spend an average of $2,780 per year on non-housing related expenses, while those over 65 spend almost twice as much, averaging $5,130 per year. This trend can largely be attributed to life stages - when people are young they are typically starting out in their careers and have less money to spare, while those who are older often have more money saved up and fewer responsibilities.

Another major trend in consumer spending is the difference between men and women. According to a report from Forbes, women account for 58% of all consumer spending in the United States. This is largely due to the fact that women tend to be responsible for most of the household shopping and decision making. In many cases, they are also the primary earners for their families.

There are also significant differences in spending habits based on income level. For example, a study from Pew Charitable Trusts found that lower-income households spend a larger percentage of their income on essential items like food and housing than higher-income households. This makes sense intuitively - people who make more money can afford to spend more on things like entertainment and luxury items.

Despite these general trends, consumer spending is highly individualized and varies greatly from person to person. So although it's impossible to make sweeping statements about how all consumers behave, understanding these overall trends can give us a better understanding of how Americans spend their money.

#  Tax revenue

Governments at all levels in the United States rely on tax revenue to fund public services. Tax policy is a critical element of state and local governance, affecting the ability of state and local governments to respond to important needs. In recent years, tax revenue has become an increasingly important issue as state and local government face budgetary constraints.

State and local tax revenue is generated from a variety of sources, including income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, and other taxes. The composition of state and local tax revenue varies across states, with some states relying more heavily on one type of tax than others. Income taxes are the most important source of tax revenue for most states, while sales taxes are the most important source of tax revenue in a few states.

Property taxes are also a significant source of tax revenue for many states. Property taxes are collected by local governments and account for a significant share of their total revenues. Property taxes are especially important in states that have neither an income nor sales tax.

Other taxes also play a role in generating state and local tax revenue. Corporate income taxes are collected by the states, and typically account for a small share of total state and local tax revenue. Excise taxes, which are levied on specific items such as gasoline or cigarettes, also generate significant revenues for some states.

The importance of different sources of state and local tax revenue varies over time as well as across states. During periods of economic expansion, income and sales tax revenues tend to grow as more people earn income and spend money. Property values also increase during expansions, leading to higher property tax collections. In contrast, during economic downturns income and sales tax revenues decline while property values fall, resulting in lower property tax collections. 

The situation is reversed in some states that do not have an incometax: Their reliance on sales taxes increases when the economy weakens because people have less money to spend on goods and services. As a result, it is not possible to make generalizations about the importance of different sources of state andlocaltax revenue across all states.

Despite the importance oftax revenue, it is often difficult to raise additional funds through taxation. This is because taxpayers may be reluctant to pay higher taxes even if they support the services funded by those taxes. There is also often strong opposition from special interest groups when lawmakers propose new or increasedtaxes. As a result, lawmakers often find it difficult to agreeon changes totax policy that would raise additional funds for state andlocalgovernments

#  Increased tourism

The Mediterranean Sea has been a popular tourist destination for centuries, but the industry has exploded in recent years. Improved infrastructure, warmer weather, and a hospitable culture have drawn people from all over the world to visit its picturesque coasts.

From Barcelona to Beirut, the region’s coastal cities are teeming with tourists. And while this influx of visitors has brought much-needed revenue to many countries, it has also created new challenges.

In particular, the increase in tourism has led to higher rents, more traffic congestion, and more waste. Moreover, some locals feel that they are being priced out of their own cities.

Governments and city planners are now grappling with how to manage this influx of tourists in a way that is equitable and sustainable. Some measures that have been proposed include developing more affordable housing, investing in public transportation, and promoting responsible tourism.

Ultimately, it is important that the benefits of tourism are shared by all members of society – locals and visitors alike. By working together, we can create a better future for the people and places of the Mediterranean Sea.

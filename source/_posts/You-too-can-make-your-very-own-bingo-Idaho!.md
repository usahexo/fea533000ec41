#  Need a new bingo game? Make your very own bingo Idaho!

If you love bingo, but are looking for a new and exciting game to play, consider making your very own bingo Idaho! This game is perfect for parties or family gatherings and can be customized to fit any occasion.

To make your own bingo Idaho, you will need some paper, pens or pencils, and some Bingo cards. Start by drawing a large square on a piece of paper. This will be your playing grid. Then, divide the square into nine smaller squares. These will be your number blocks. In the upper right corner of each block, write a number from 1 to 9.

Next, fill in the squares with random numbers. You can use dice to generate the numbers or simply make them up yourself. Once you have filled in all of the squares, it’s time to play!

To play bingo Idaho, someone calls out a number and players mark that number on their Bingo cards. The first player to get five numbers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game!

## What you will need

* A printer (or access to a printer)
* Paper
* Bingo markers (or something to use as bingo markers - we recommend using blue painters tape)
* A copy of the Idaho Bingo game board
* The Idaho Bingo game rules

## Step One: Print out the Idaho Bingo game board on standard printer paper.

If you do not have a printer, you can access a printable version of the Idaho Bingo game board [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lu7t5l3a3cmwb21/Idaho%20Bingo.pdf?dl=0 "Idaho Bingo game board").




















 ## Step Two: Cut out the Idaho Bingo game board along the black lines. Once it is cut out, you can discard the excess paper. 

If you do not have a pair of scissors, you can ask someone else to help with this step or simply unfold the paper until you reach the black lines and then cut along them with a pen or other sharp object. Just be careful not to damage the paper!



            ## Step Three: Place the Idaho Bingo game board in front of you so that the top row of cards is closest to you and the bottom row is furthest from you. If you are playing with others, make sure every player has their own copy of the card. Now it’s time to fill in your cards! We recommend using blue painters tape as bingo markers, but feel free to use any object that will work for you. Each time you daub (mark) a square on your card, make sure to yell “Bingo!” or some variation thereof so that everyone knows that your card is complete.

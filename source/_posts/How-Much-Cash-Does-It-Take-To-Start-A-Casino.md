#  How Much Cash Does It Take To Start A Casino?

Gambling is big business, and casino gambling is no exception. In fact, the gambling industry as a whole generates well over $100 billion in revenue every year. So it's no surprise that people are always looking to get into the casino business. But how much cash does it take to start a casino?

The short answer is: It depends.

There are a lot of factors that go into starting a casino, from the cost of real estate to the licensing fees required by the state. And then there are the costs associated with building and equipping a casino complex. All told, startup costs can range from just a few million dollars to several hundred million dollars or more.

But let's take a look at some hypothetical examples to give you an idea of what's involved.

Assume you want to open a small casino in a rural area. The cost of real estate might be just $1 million, but licensing and regulatory fees could be another $1 million. You would also need to budget for gaming equipment ($5 million), furniture and fixtures ($1 million), and advertising and marketing ($2 million). That brings your total startup costs to $10 million.

Now let's suppose you want to open a larger casino in a major metropolitan area. The cost of real estate could be as high as $50 million, and licensing and regulatory fees could run $10 million or more. You would also need to budget for gaming equipment ($200 million), furniture and fixtures ($20 million), and advertising and marketing ($20 million). That brings your total startup costs to $300 million or more.

So as you can see, it takes quite a bit of money to start up a casino. But with so much at stake, there's no doubt that casinos are worth the investment.

#  Casino Tycoon Indian Businessman Gives Away $2 Billion In Cash

An Indian business tycoon, who made his fortune in the casino industry, has given away almost $2 billion in cash to charities in India.

The businessman, who wishes to remain anonymous, says he made the decision to give away the money after he got a "divine message" from a spiritual guru.

"I was told by the guru that it is my duty to help those who are less fortunate than me," said the businessman. "So I decided to give away all my money to charity."

Most of the money has been given to charities that help poorer sections of Indian society, such as orphans and widows. The businessman also paid for the construction of several schools and hospitals in rural areas.

His generosity has won him praise from many people in India, who have dubbed him a "saintly figure."

"This man is a real-life hero," said one person. "He has shown us that it is more important to help others than to amass wealth."

The businessman says he doesn't care about becoming wealthy or famous and only wants to do what is right by God.

#  Russian Oligarch All In On Atlantic City Casino

Mikhail Prokhorov, one of the richest men in Russia and the owner of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, has made a major investment in Atlantic City’s newest casino.

The billionaire oligarch has put up $225 million to help finance the construction of the new Revel Casino Hotel, which is scheduled to open in 2012. In return, he will receive a stake of just over 50% in the casino.

This is not Prokhorov’s first foray into the world of gambling; he also owns a casino in Russia. But this is his most high-profile venture yet, and it could be a major boost for Atlantic City’s struggling gaming industry.

Revel Casino Hotel is being built on the site of the old Sands Casino Hotel, which was demolished last year. The new casino will have 3,800 rooms and slot machines as well as table games. It is expected to create 2,500 jobs when it opens.

Atlantic City has been hit hard by the economic recession; its casino industry has been battered by competition from casinos in neighboring states. Several casinos have closed in recent years, leaving the city with 11 gaming establishments.

Revel Casino Hotel is hoping to turn things around for Atlantic City; its backers believe that its location overlooking the ocean and its wide range of amenities will make it a major draw for tourists and gamblers.

Mikhail Prokhorov is certainly betting that this will be the case; his investment in Revel Casino Hotel is a clear sign of confidence in Atlantic City’s future.

# Roth to Appear in New Blackjack Equipment Commercial

In a recent turn of events, professional poker player and World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet winner, Max Roth, will be appearing in a new Blackjack equipment commercial. The spot, which is set to air nationally starting in late September, features Roth demonstrating the gameplay and ease of use of the new product.

When asked about his upcoming commercial debut, Roth had this to say:
"I'm really excited to be a part of this new Blackjack equipment commercial. The product is great and I think it will really help players everywhere improve their game. I can't wait for everyone to see it!"

Roth is coming off a particularly strong year both in live and online poker. In July he won his second WSOP bracelet when he took down the $1,500 Seven-Card Stud event. This follows up on his first WSOP win back in 2013 when he took down the $3,000 Pot-Limit Omaha event.

Roth has also been doing well online recently. In August he final tabled the $2,600 buy-in Super High Roller event on PokerStars for over $146,000. He followed that up by finishing 3rd in the $10,300 buy-in High Roller event on partypoker for over $97,000.

With his continued success in poker, it's no surprise that Roth was chosen to star in the new Blackjack equipment commercial. We can expect to see more of Roth as he continues to make a name for himself in the poker world.

#  What is Asgard Warriors about?

Asgard Warriors is an app that allows you to play with warriors from Norse mythology. You can select your favorite god, and then use that god’s strengths and abilities to fight against other players. There are many different ways to play, so you can always find a new challenge.

The app was created by Plarium, a company well known for creating mobile games. They have created several popular titles such as Vikings: War of Clans, Total Domination: Reborn, and Throne: Kingdom at War. So, it is safe to say that the developers have a great deal of experience when it comes to making strategy games.

# What do I need to know about the game?

There are 3 main things you need to understand about Asgard Warriors in order to start playing effectively: buildings, troops, and combat.

# Buildings 
Each village in Asgard Warriors is made up of buildings. The most important buildings are the ones that produce troops. The more troops you have, the more you can attack other villages and steal their resources. There are also other buildings that provide benefits such as faster troop production or increased stats for your warriors. It is important to make sure your village is well defended, so you should place defensive buildings around your important structures.

# Troops 
There are 4 different types of troops in Asgard Warriors: infantry, archers, cavalry, and siege engines. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses which you will need to exploit in order to win battles. For example, infantry are good at taking down enemy archers, while cavalry can destroy siege engines quickly. You will want to make sure you have a mix of all four troop types in order to be successful in battle.

# Combat 
Battles take place on a battlefield where each player has a set number of troops available. The goal is to kill all of the opponent’s troops or conquer their castle. In order to do this, you will need to use your strategic skills and timing correctly. For example, if you know your opponent has more cavalry than you do, then you will want to wait until they attack before sending in your infantry and archers.

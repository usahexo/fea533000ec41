In fact, the gambling industry as a whole generates well over $100 billion in revenue every year. So it’s no surprise that people are always looking to get into the casino business. But how much cash does it take to start a casino?</p>
<p>The short answer is: It depends.</p>
<p>There are a lot of factors that go into starting a casino, from the cost of real estate to the licensing fees required by the state. And then there are the costs associated with building and equipping a casino complex. All told, startup costs can range from just a few million dollars to several hundred million dollars or more.</p>
<p>But let’s take a look at some hypothetical examples to give you an idea of what’s involved.</p>
<p>Assume you want to open a small casino in a rural area. The cost of real estate might be just $1 million, but licensing and regulatory fees could be another $1 million. You would also need to budget for gaming equipment ($5 million), furniture and fixtures ($1 million), and advertising and marketing ($2 million). That brings your total startup costs to $10 million.</p>
<p>Now let’s suppose you want to open a larger casino in a major metropolitan area. The cost of real estate could be as high as $50 million, and licensing and regulatory fees could run $10 million or more. You would also need to budget for gaming equipment ($200 million), furniture and fixtures ($20 million), and advertising and marketing ($20 million). That brings your total startup costs to $300 million or more.</p>
<p>So as you can see, it takes quite a bit of money to start up a casino. But with so much at stake, there’s no doubt that casinos are worth the investment.</p>

<p>The businessman, who wishes to remain anonymous, says he made the decision to give away the money after he got a “divine message” from a spiritual guru.</p>
<p>“I was told by the guru that it is my duty to help those who are less fortunate than me,” said the businessman. “So I decided to give away all my money to charity.”</p>
<p>Most of the money has been given to charities that help poorer sections of Indian society, such as orphans and widows. The businessman also paid for the construction of several schools and hospitals in rural areas.</p>
<p>His generosity has won him praise from many people in India, who have dubbed him a “saintly figure.”</p>
<p>“This man is a real-life hero,” said one person. “He has shown us that it is more important to help others than to amass wealth.”</p>
<p>The businessman says he doesn’t care about becoming wealthy or famous and only wants to do what is right by God.</p>

He is one of the early investors in Las Vegas Sands Corporation, the company that owns The Venetian and Palazzo resorts in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Gates joins other billionaires including Sheldon Adelson, founder of Las Vegas Sands, and Carl Icahn, who are also investors in the company. Gates has a fortune of $76 billion, according to Forbes magazine.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands is one of the most profitable casino companies in the world. It reported profits of $2.3 billion last year. Adelson, who is chairman and CEO of Las Vegas Sands, is worth $37 billion, according to Forbes.</p>
<p>The Venetian and Palazzo are some of the most luxurious casinos in the world. The Venetian features a replica of St Mark’s Square in Venice, Italy, while the Palazzo has a spa that is bigger than most hotels.</p>
<p>Other billionaires who have invested in Las Vegas Sands include Steve Jobs’ widow Laurene Powell Jobs and hedge fund manager John Paulson.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Oligarch-All-In-On-Atlantic-City-Casino"><a href="#Russian-Oligarch-All-In-On-Atlantic-City-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Russian Oligarch All In On Atlantic City Casino"></a>Russian Oligarch All In On Atlantic City Casino</h1><p>Mikhail Prokhorov, one of the richest men in Russia and the owner of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets, has made a major investment in Atlantic City’s newest casino.</p>
<p>The billionaire oligarch has put up $225 million to help finance the construction of the new Revel Casino Hotel, which is scheduled to open in 2012. In return, he will receive a stake of just over 50% in the casino.</p>
<p>This is not Prokhorov’s first foray into the world of gambling; he also owns a casino in Russia. But this is his most high-profile venture yet, and it could be a major boost for Atlantic City’s struggling gaming industry.</p>
<p>Revel Casino Hotel is being built on the site of the old Sands Casino Hotel, which was demolished last year. The new casino will have 3,800 rooms and slot machines as well as table games. It is expected to create 2,500 jobs when it opens.</p>
<p>Atlantic City has been hit hard by the economic recession; its casino industry has been battered by competition from casinos in neighboring states. Several casinos have closed in recent years, leaving the city with 11 gaming establishments.</p>
<p>Revel Casino Hotel is hoping to turn things around for Atlantic City; its backers believe that its location overlooking the ocean and its wide range of amenities will make it a major draw for tourists and gamblers.</p>
<p>Mikhail Prokhorov is certainly betting that this will be the case; his investment in Revel Casino Hotel is a clear sign of confidence in Atlantic City’s future.</p>

Not only do you have to consider the costs associated with starting and running a casino, but you’ll also need to factor in the amount of money needed to win approval from gaming regulators.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a license to operate a casino in the United States, you’ll typically need to have between $2 and $5 million in liquid assets. This money is used as a security deposit, which is refunded once your casino has been up and running for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The exact amount of money you’ll need to start a casino will vary depending on the location. In some cases, you may need to pay higher licensing fees or have more money on hand to cover other costs associated with starting a casino.</p>
<p>So how much does it cost to start up and run a casino? Here’s an overview of some of the key expenses:</p>
<p>Licensing Fees - In order to legally operate a casino, you’ll need to obtain a gaming license from the relevant gaming authority. The cost of this license can range from tens of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars, depending on the jurisdiction.</p>

The club is situated at the corner of Ashton New Road and Maine Road in the Moss Side area of south Manchester.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-club’s-history"><a href="#What-is-the-club’s-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the club’s history?"></a>What is the club’s history?</h1><p>The Detroit Lions are a professional American football team based in Detroit, Michigan. The Lions compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league’s National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Ford Field in Downtown Detroit.</p>
<p>The club was founded on August 29, 1930, as the Portsmouth Spartans. Based in Portsmouth, Ohio, they were one of the eight members of the American Football League (AFL). The Spartans merged with the NFL’s Chicago Bears in 1934.</p>
<p>The club then moved to Detroit and changed its name to the Lions. As part of the merger agreement, the winner of each divisional playoff game played between two NFC divisional winners would earn a spot in the NFL Championship Game. The Lions have reached the playoffs ten times, winning four NFL championships and losing four others. The last appearance was during the 1993 season.</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions are one of four charter members of the NFL still in existence, along with the Arizona Cardinals, Chicago Bears, and Cleveland Browns.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-current-owners-and-what-is-their-motive-for-owning-the-club"><a href="#Who-are-the-current-owners-and-what-is-their-motive-for-owning-the-club" class="headerlink" title="Who are the current owners and what is their motive for owning the club?"></a>Who are the current owners and what is their motive for owning the club?</h1><p>The current owners of Arsenal are Stan Kroenke and his son Josh Kroenke. Stan Kroenke is the majority shareholder with 67% of the shares, and Josh Kroenke has a 30% stake in the club. The motives of the Kroenkes for owning Arsenal are primarily financial. They want to make money from the club through television rights, ticket sales, and merchandising.</p>
<p>The Kroenkes have been criticised by some Arsenal fans for not investing enough in the team in order to challenge for the Premier League title. However, they have recently increased their investment in the team, with Stan Kroenke making a £200 million cash injection in January 2018. This has led to some speculation that the Kroenkes may be preparing for a sale of Arsenal.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Stan-Kroenke’s-net-worth"><a href="#What-is-Stan-Kroenke’s-net-worth" class="headerlink" title="What is Stan Kroenke’s net worth?"></a>What is Stan Kroenke’s net worth?</h1><p>Stan Kroenke is one of the richest men in America, with a net worth estimated at $7.3 billion in 2018. He made his fortune through his ownership of various sporting franchises, including NFL team Los Angeles Rams, NBA team Denver Nuggets, and NHL team Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p>Kroenke also has a significant real estate portfolio, which includes 35,000 acres of land in Texas and Montana. In addition to his holdings in Arsenal, he also has a minority shareholding in Spanish football club Atletico Madrid.</p>
<h1 id="How-successful-have-they-been-in-recent-years"><a href="#How-successful-have-they-been-in-recent-years" class="headerlink" title="How successful have they been in recent years?"></a>How successful have they been in recent years?</h1><p>The Detroit Red Wings are a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Red Wings are one of the Original Six teams of the NHL, and are one of the most successful franchises in the league.</p>
<p>The franchise was founded on September 25, 1926, as the Detroit Cougars by James E. Norris, owner of the nationalist St. Louis Blues. The team rose to prominence in 1933 after hiring Jack Adams as head coach. Under Adams led them to first place in the American Division three times and a Stanley Cup championship in 1936. However, they would struggle for much of the 1940s until hiring Tommy Ivan as head coach who would lead them to second place in the NHL for four consecutive seasons and a another Stanley Cup championship in 1950.</p>
<p>The Red Wings would then enter into a 43-year drought without winning any playoff series until finally breaking through in 1993 under coach Scotty Bowman which would start their current 25-year playoff streak which is currently still active. During this time, they would make it to 6 Stanley Cup finals but lose all six times until finally winning their eleventh Stanley Cup in 2008 with captain Nicklas Lidstrom. Lidstrom retired from playing at the end of that season and Henrik Zetterberg was named captain making him only the second European captain in league history (the first being Mats Sundin).</p>
<p>Since their last championship win, they have made it back to the playoffs every year but have yet to make it back to the finals though they came close in 2013 when they lost to eventual champions Chicago Blackhawks in 7 games during the semi-finals. Pavel Datsyuk has been one of their most important players during this time as he has won 3 Frank J. Selke Awards as best defensive forward and 4 Lady Byng Memorial Trophies for gentlemanly play and sportsmanship. Henrik Zetterberg has also been very successful during this time, winning 2 Lester B Pearson Awards given to the most outstanding player as voted by fellow players and 1 Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the playoffs.</p>

He is also the sixth-highest scorer in Premier League history. Aguero is known for his pace and finishing ability, as well as his passion for the game.</p>

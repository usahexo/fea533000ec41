        <h1 id="Online-Gambling-Losses-May-Be-Tax-Deductible"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Losses-May-Be-Tax-Deductible" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Losses May Be Tax Deductible"></a>Online Gambling Losses May Be Tax Deductible</h1><p>Online gambling losses may be deductible on your federal income tax return, but only to the extent of your winnings. This means that if you lost more money than you won, you cannot deduct the entire amount of your losses.</p>
<p>Only individuals who itemize their deductions on Schedule A can claim this deduction. To do so, you will need to complete IRS Form 1040 and attach Schedule A.</p>
<p>The deduction is available for all types of gambling, including casino games, horse racing, and lotteries. However, it does not apply to wagers made on sports events or other races.</p>
<p>In order to claim the deduction, you must keep track of your winnings and losses each year. You can use any reasonable method for tracking, such as keeping a detailed diary or maintaining a spreadsheet. If you forget to keep track of your losses one year, you can still go back and claim them for up to three years in the past.</p>
<p>There is no set limit on how much you can deduct for gambling losses, but you cannot exceed the amount of your winnings. For example, if you won $1,000 in casino games and lost $1,200, your deduction would be limited to $1,000.</p>
<p>Gambling losses are considered an itemized deduction. This means that they reduce the amount of taxable income that you report on your return. In other words, they help lower your tax bill.</p>
<p>Itemized deductions are claimed as a percentage of your adjusted gross income (AGI). The AGI is calculated by subtracting certain deductions from your total income. For 2018 tax returns, the allowable deductions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>medical expenses that exceed 10% of AGI; </li>
<li>state and local taxes (or property taxes) that exceed $10,000; </li>
<li>mortgage interest and home equity loan interest totaling more than $750; </li>
<li>charitable contributions totaling more than 60% of AGI; and </li>
<li>miscellaneous deductions (such as unreimbursed employee expenses) that exceed 2% of AGI.</li>
</ul>
<p> If your total itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction for your filing status – which is $12,000 for single taxpayers and married couples filing jointly in 2018 – then it makes sense to itemize them instead of taking the standard deduction. </p>
<p> Gambling losses are reported on Schedule A as Other Miscellaneous Deductions. This is a specific category found near the bottom of Part II of the form. Other Miscellaneous Deductions includes a wide variety of expenses such as job-related travel costs, education expenses, and legal fees paid in connection with producing taxable income.<br>Many taxpayers find that their gambling losses outweigh their other miscellaneous deductions, which is why this category is often referred to as the “gambling loss deduction”. However, only those who itemize their deductions can take advantage of it. </p>
<p> If you have questions about whether or not online gambling losses are tax deductible, be sure to contact a qualified tax professional for advice specific to your situation</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-Can-Write-Off-Internet-Casino-Losses"><a href="#Gamblers-Can-Write-Off-Internet-Casino-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers Can Write Off Internet Casino Losses"></a>Gamblers Can Write Off Internet Casino Losses</h1><p>Beginning in tax year 2018, U.S. taxpayers who gamble at internet casinos can write off their losses on their taxes. The new law was passed as part of the GOP’s overhaul of the U.S. tax code in December 2017.</p>
<p>The change is good news for gamblers, who can now deduct their losses up to the amount of their winnings. This means that if you lose $1,000 gambling online, you can deduct that amount from your taxable income.</p>
<p>The deduction is available to both individual taxpayers and businesses. However, it is not available to those who gamble in person at a casino or racetrack.</p>
<p>The change in the tax law was welcomed by the gambling industry, which has been lobbying for years for the ability to write off internet casino losses. Supporters of the change argue that it will help level the playing field between online and offline casinos.</p>
<p>Critics of the change say that it will lead to more gambling and could increase problem gambling rates. However, there is no evidence yet that either of these things will happen.</p>
<p>So far, only a handful of states have decided how they will treat internet casino losses under their state income taxes. Most states are waiting for guidance from the IRS before making a decision.</p>
<h1 id="Tax-Tips-How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Tax-Tips-How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Tax Tips: How To Claim Gambling Losses"></a>Tax Tips: How To Claim Gambling Losses</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting pastime, but it can also be costly. If you’re not lucky at the tables or the track, gambling losses can add up quickly. Luckily, you may be able to write off some of those losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>Here are four tips on how to claim gambling losses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep Good Records</li>
</ol>
<p>You need to keep good records of your gambling wins and losses to prove that you are eligible to write off your losses. In addition to documenting your winnings and losses, keep track of the dates, times, casinos, and amounts won and lost. This information will come in handy if the IRS ever questions your deduction.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Claim Gambling Losses as a Deduction</li>
</ol>
<p>You can write off your gambling losses as a deduction on your tax return. To do this, you need to itemize your deductions on Schedule A. Be sure to include the amount of your gambling losses and their associated documentation in the “Other Miscellaneous Deductions” section of Schedule A.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Claim Only Gambling Losses That Exceed Your Winnings</li>
</ol>
<p>You can only claim gambling losses that exceed your winnings for the year. If you had $1,000 in winnings and $1,500 in losses, you can only deduct $500 in gambling losses ($1,500 – $1,000). However, if you have additional qualifying expenses related to gambling (e.g., transportation costs), you may be able to deduct those expenses as well.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Report Gambling Winnings as Income</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you lose money while gambling, you are still required to report any winnings as income on your tax return. This includes both cash and non-cash prizes. Reporting all of your gambling income is important because it helps ensure that you don’t pay taxes on money that you have already lost!</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-To-Know-About-deducting-gambling-losses"><a href="#What-You-Need-To-Know-About-deducting-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="What You Need To Know About deducting gambling losses"></a>What You Need To Know About deducting gambling losses</h1><p>Deducting gambling losses can save taxpayers a lot of money on their taxes, but there are some things they need to know in order to do it correctly. This article will explain what those things are.</p>
<p>The first thing taxpayers need to know is that they can only deduct gambling losses if they itemize their deductions. This means they cannot take the standard deduction, which is $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly in 2019.</p>
<p>The second thing taxpayers need to know is that they can only deduct gambling losses up to the amount of their gambling winnings. So, if a taxpayer has $1,000 in gambling winnings and $2,000 in gambling losses, they can only deduct $1,000 on their taxes.</p>
<p>The third thing taxpayers need to know is that they can only deduct gambling losses if they have documentation to support them. This means taxpayers need to keep track of their winnings and losses each year and have receipts or other documentation to back them up.</p>
<p>The fourth thing taxpayers need to know is that the deduction for gambling losses is subject to the same limitations as other itemized deductions. So, if a taxpayer has high medical expenses or large state and local taxes, their deduction for gambling losses may be reduced.</p>
<p>The fifth thing taxpayers need to know is that the IRS offers a special rule for people who gamble in a professional capacity. Under this rule, these taxpayers can deduct all of their gambling losses, even if they don’t have any documentation to support them. This rule applies only to people who meet certain requirements, so taxpayers should check with the IRS if they think it may apply to them.</p>
<h1 id="Can-I-Deduct-My-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Can-I-Deduct-My-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Can I Deduct My Gambling Losses?"></a>Can I Deduct My Gambling Losses?</h1><p>The unfortunate reality of gambling is that you can sometimes lose a lot of money. But can you write those losses off on your taxes?</p>
<p>In general, the answer is no. Gambling losses are not tax deductible. This is true whether you are a professional gambler or just a recreational player.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule, but they are very limited. For example, you may be able to deduct gambling losses if you can prove that you incurred the losses in order to earn taxable income. Additionally, you may be able to deduct gambling losses if they are related to business activity.</p>
<p>But in most cases, gambling losses cannot be deducted from your taxes. So if you’re hoping to recoup some of your gambling losses at tax time, you’re out of luck.</p>

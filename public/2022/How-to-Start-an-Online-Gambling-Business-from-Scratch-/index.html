<li>Betting License: A betting license allows you to offer bets on sports or other events, but does not allow you to offer casino games or poker. This option is less expensive than a gambling license, but offers less protection for your business. </li>
<li>White Label Solution: A white label solution is a third-party provider that allows you to offer online gambling services without having to obtain a license yourself. This option is the least expensive and fastest way to get started, but offers less protection for your business.</li>

<h1 id="What-is-the-Cleveland-Cavaliers"><a href="#What-is-the-Cleveland-Cavaliers" class="headerlink" title="What is the Cleveland Cavaliers?"></a>What is the Cleveland Cavaliers?</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Cavaliers play their home games at Quicken Loans Arena in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. The franchise was founded in 1970 as an expansion team. The Cavaliers have won four Central Division championships, three Eastern Conference championships, and one NBA championship in 2016.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers began playing in the NBA in 1970 as an expansion team along with the Portland Trail Blazers. They struggled in their early years, but came into their own in the late 1970s with the addition of heart and soul player Austin Carr. The Cavs made it to the playoffs for the first time in 1976 and would go on to make the postseason 16 times over their first 35 seasons. Cleveland had some successful years in that span, making it to the Eastern Conference Finals three times. However, they were never able to breakthrough and win an NBA championship.</p>
<p>Things turned around for the Cavs starting with the 2003-2004 season. LeBron James, who was drafted by the Cavs out of high school, emerged as one of the best players in the league and led Cleveland to eight consecutive playoff appearances. While James led the Cavs to individual success, they were never able to break through and win an NBA championship – losing twice in the Finals. In 2010, James decided to leave for Miami Heat where he won two championships.</p>
<p>After four years without James, Cleveland got him back via free agency in 2014. This move proved to be one of the most polarizing moments in sports history as many felt that James “betrayed” his home state by leaving them again. However, things turned out well for James and the Cavs as they eventually won their first championship together in 2016 – upsetting Golden State Warriors 4-3 in dramatic fashion.</p>
<h1 id="Who-was-Thackeray"><a href="#Who-was-Thackeray" class="headerlink" title="Who was Thackeray?"></a>Who was Thackeray?</h1><p>William Makepeace Thackeray was born on 18th July 1811, in Calcutta, India, and died on 23rd December 1863. He was an English novelist and humorist, who is regarded as one of the most important writers of the 19th century.</p>
<h1 id="His-life"><a href="#His-life" class="headerlink" title="His life"></a>His life</h1><p>Thackeray’s childhood was spent in India, where his father was an administrator for the British East India Company. When he was just four years old, he witnessed the Indian Rebellion of 1857 – also known as the Sepoy Mutiny – and this event had a lasting impression on him. In 1817, the Thackeray family moved back to England and William was sent to boarding school. He later attended Trinity College, Cambridge but left without taking a degree.</p>
<h1 id="Career"><a href="#Career" class="headerlink" title="Career"></a>Career</h1><p>Thackeray’s first book, The Luck of Barry Lyndon (1844), was published when he was just 33 years old. It is a picaresque novel based on the real-life exploits of an Irish gambler and rake. However, it was his next novel – Vanity Fair (1847) – which brought him international acclaim. Set in early 19th-century England, it tells the story of two women: Becky Sharp, a scheming social climber, and Amelia Sedley, an honest but naive young girl. The novel satirizes British society at the time and has been described as “the greatest novel of manners written in English”.</p>
<p>Other famous novels by Thackeray include Pendennis (1848), Henry Esmond (1852), The Newcomes (1855) and The Virginians (1859). He also wrote a number of short stories and essays, including “The English Humorists of the Eighteenth Century” (1851) and “The Four Georges” (1860).</p>
<h1 id="Death"><a href="#Death" class="headerlink" title="Death"></a>Death</h1><p>Thackeray suffered from poor health for much of his life and he eventually died from stomach cancer on 23rd December 1863. He was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Cleveland-Cavaliers’-five-championships"><a href="#What-are-the-Cleveland-Cavaliers’-five-championships" class="headerlink" title="What are the Cleveland Cavaliers’ five championships?"></a>What are the Cleveland Cavaliers’ five championships?</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers are a professional basketball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league’s Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded in 1970 as an expansion team, and eventually won their first championship in 2016. Here are the five championships that the Cavaliers have won:</p>
<ol>

</li>
<li><p>2007: The Cavaliers defeated the Detroit Pistons in six games to win their first conference championship.</p>
</li>

This was a culmination of an amazing comeback story, as they were down 3-1 in the finals against the Golden State Warriors. Kyrie Irving was named Finals MVP after averaging 27.3 points per game in the series.</p>
